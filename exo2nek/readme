Could also use a .bc file to set boundary conditions
		  
1                                  ! number of non-periodic boundary condition
7 W                                ! sideset number, boundary condition
3 1e-6                             ! number of pairs of periodic boundary condition, tolerence
1 2 0.0 0.0 10.0                   ! sideset 1 mapping to sideset 2, with vector (0.0,0.0,10.0)
3 4 0.86602540378 -0.5 0.0         ! sideset 3 mapping to sideset 4, with vector (0.86602540378,-0.5,0.0)
5 6 -0.86602540378 -0.5 0.0        ! sideset 5 mapping to sideset 6, with vector (-0.86602540378,-0.5,0.0)

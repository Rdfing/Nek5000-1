based on Nek5000 v19

Haomin Yuan, 3/8/2019

implement a "pseudo convection term implicit" solver to Nek5000.

In current Nek5000, convection term (in pressure-velocity eqns and passive scalar eqns)
is explicitly extrapolated from previous time steps.
And convection term  does not change even increase ngeom.

This brings great disadvantages when pressure-velocity eqns are in strong coupling with passive scalar eqns.

For example, in low-mach approximation, enthalpy eqn (1st passive scalar) does effect properties (density and viscosity)
in a very strong fashion. Thus, pressure-velocity eqns and enthalpy eqn should be iterated several times in one time-step.
And convection term should be updated in each iteration.

Another example is with turbulence model. 
for both k-epsilon or k-omega, 2nd and 3rd passive scalar eqn are used. 
And turbulence viscosity is updated, and affect pressure-velocity eqns.
Thus multiple iterations should be implemented to improve stability.

WHAT ARE CHANGED FROM OFFICIAL SOLVER:

1. advance_implicit() should replace advance() in "drive1.f" nek__multi_advance
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
      subroutine nek__multi_advance(kstep,msteps)

      include 'SIZE'
      include 'TOTAL'

      do i=1,msteps
         istep = istep+i
c         call nek_advance
         call nek_advance_implicit

         if (ifneknekc) then 
            call neknek_exchange
            call bcopy
            call chk_outflow
         endif
      enddo

      return
      end
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. in nek_advance_implicit

in official solver ngeom is default to be 2.
at igeom = 1, explicit term are calculated.
explicit term includes part of time derivative term and convective term.
convective term is explicit extrapolated using AB scheme from previous time step.

at igeom = 2, implicit term are constructed. And velocities/pressure/PS are solved.
explicit term includes rest part of time derivative term and diffusion term.

in nek_advance_implicit, ngeom should at least be 3. 
at igeom =1,2, it does the same thing of the official solver.

at igeom =3 or larger, convective term is updated with new velocity.
but time derivative term  from old time steps are not changed.
Then explicit term are recalculated.
And implicit term are reconstructed.
And velocities/pressure/PS are resolved.

Thus a "pseudo convection term implicit" solver is constructed.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. only a periodic tube case is tested.
data from "implicit solver " and official solver are matching

2. more test cases should be done. 
so no guarantee this solver is free of problems.


USAGE NOTE:
1. pn-pn is a must
2. no characteristic scheme, ie ifchar=False
3. no moving mesh

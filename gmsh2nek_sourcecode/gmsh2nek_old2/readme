gmsh2nek
convert gmsh .msh (version 2, ascii/binary format) to nek .re2 file
only support 3D mesh

notes about compilation

1. before compilation of gmsh2nek
in
/Nek5000/tools/makefile

add

          if [ "$$i" == "gmsh2nek" ]; then       \
             export FFLAGS+=" ${R8}" ;           \
             if [ ! -z $(DOALL) ]; then          \
                continue;                        \
             fi ;                                \
          fi ;                                   \

to the end of exo2nek part.
		  

notes about usage
1. for volume elements, only hex20/hex27 elements. 
Physical tags are needed for volume elements to be dumped out by gmsh
2. for surface elements, quad8/quad9 are need to assign boudaries/boundary condition. 
Physical tags (surface number) are needed for all surface elements to be dumped out by gmsh
3. For converted mesh, boundary conditions are actually set in nek .usr file

Please in include the following subroutines in usrdat2()

      do iel=1,nelv
      do ifc=1,2*ndim
        id_face = bc(5,ifc,iel,1)
        if (id_face.eq.1) then        ! surface 1 for inlet 
           cbc(ifc,iel,1) = 'v  '
        elseif (id_face.eq.2) then    ! surface 2 for outlet
           cbc(ifc,iel,1) = 'O  '
        elseif (id_face.eq.3) then    ! surface 3 for wall
           cbc(ifc,iel,1) = 'W  '
        endif
      enddo
      enddo

id_face is the physical tags assigned to surface elements.

4. You could also include a .bc file to direct assign boundary when doing gmsh2nek conversion
please check doubleY.bc in gmsh2nek_testcases/

doubleY.bc

1                            ! number of non-periodic boundary condition
7 W                          ! physical tag number, boundary condition (note for wall is 'W  ', inlet for 'v  ', etc)
3 1e-6                       ! number of pairs of periodic boundary condition, tolerence
1 2 0.0 0.0 10.0             ! surface 1 mapping to surface 2, with vector (0.0,0.0,10.0)
3 4 0.86602540378 -0.5 0.0   ! surface 3 mapping to surface 4, with vector (0.86602540378,-0.5,0.0)
5 6 -0.86602540378 -0.5 0.0  ! surface 5 mapping to surface 6, with vector (-0.86602540378,-0.5,0.0)
                             ! mesh on periodic surface should be conformal.
